## Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard 

# Synopsis
The Novel Coronavirus (CODIV-19) outbreak is now spreading around the world, with more than 100,000 cases and >3,000 deaths. This live-updating dashboard provides a way for us to track the virus, which has now been classified as a pandemic. 

# Technicalities 
This dasboard is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery in the front-end. We also used Bulma as an alternaitive to Bootsrap (https://bulma.io). We also used server side APIs and a third-party API to pull data. Data was pulled from two sources: RapidAPI (https://coronavirus-monitor.p.rapidapi.com/coronavirus/cases_by_country.php) and https://covid19.mathdro.id/api.
